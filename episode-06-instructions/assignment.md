# C Instructions â€“ Assignment

This assignment will reinforce the understanding of the three fundamental instruction types in C:

1. Type Declaration Instructions  
2. Arithmetic Instructions  
3. Control Program Instructions

## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Type Declaration

Declare the following variables with appropriate types:

- An integer variable `age` initialized to 20  
- A floating-point variable `height` initialized to 5.9  
- A boolean variable `isStudent` set to true  
- A character variable `grade` set to 'A'

Use `#include <stdbool.h>` for boolean types.

### Task 2: Arithmetic Calculation

Write a C program to calculate the result of the following expression and print the result:

```c
5 + 10 * 2 - 8 / 4
````

Print the result using `printf`.

### Task 3: Mixed Data Types

Write a program to multiply an `int` and a `float` and store the result in a `double`. Print the result.
